Jonathan Gross

1. Linus Torvalds (perhaps one of 30 some Torvalds that exist), created Git.

2. In 1991 Linus created the free Linux os kernel because he couldn't afford the 
Unix system, which had limited features for private users. 

3. Git was originally made in 2005 to support Linux, with features that were learned/adapted from BitKeeper. 

4. git init creates a new empty repository. 

5. Once I have declared I am ready to share my file changes (git add), 
and I have committed those changes (stamped with a message), I need to send 
those changes on my computer to my repository on github by "pushing" them.
