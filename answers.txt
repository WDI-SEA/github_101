1) Linus Torvalds
2) He is famous for inventing Linux.
3) It was invented in 2005.
4) git init
5) git push is updating the remote repository. To add some more information, in
   this case 'git push' is using the default settings. In class, this would
   have fast forwarded the remote branch (the forked master repository that we
   had cloned) to match the status of what we were pushing. Since we were
   using Github in class, that is the host of the repository that we were
   pushing to. It really depends on the settings/context, but the way
   I interpret that commmand is "bring the remote branch, of this branch that
   i'm working on, up to date with my local branch".
